# TwitterFeedConsoleApp
This Console app is built using C# and .Net Framework 4.8.
You would need Visual Studio to open the SLN (TwitterFeedConsoleApp.sln) file.
The 2 .txt files are included in a RESX file (FileResource.resx) in the Class Library called "Data".
Please do a build on the solution before running it to see if you need to re-wire any project references for each library.
